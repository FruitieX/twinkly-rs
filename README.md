# twinkly-rs

Unofficial [Twinkly](https://www.twinkly.com/) library for the Rust programming language.

Big thanks to the xled project for reverse engineering and documenting the Twinkly API over at https://xled-docs.readthedocs.io/

Note that this project is in early stages. If you feel there's something missing, please open a PR!

In its current state the library is mostly only useful for showing realtime effects on the device.

## Support

I've only tested this on Generation II Twinkly strings running firmware version `2.8.4`.

## Sample usage

Refer to `main.rs` for now.
